Bankruptcy is the legal process by which creditors will recover their dues from an insolvent/bankrupt business/person by liquidating the remaining assets of the business. 
So, Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm mainly used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the failure probability of a firm.

Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value.It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, 
etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.
We will be working on the logistic regression for a bankruptcy prediction model. We will predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not using a Company Bankruptcy 
Prediction dataset,a Bankruptcy data from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999â€“2009.

This project can be used as a base for analysing a firm's bankruptcy by using different datasets.
